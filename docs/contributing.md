## Code of Conduct

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by these principles.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**:

   - Fork the Intric repository to your GitHub account.
   - Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intric-community.git`

2. **Set Up Development Environment**:

   - Follow the instructions in the [Development Guide](development-guide.md) to set up your local environment.

3. **Find an Issue**:
   - Look for open issues in our GitHub issue tracker.
   - Comment on the issue to express your interest in working on it.
   - If you have a new idea, open an issue to discuss it before implementing.

## Development Workflow

We follow a branch-based workflow:

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**:

   - We follow conventional commit messages:
     ```
     feat: add new feature X
     fix: resolve issue with Y
     chore: update dependencies
     docs: improve documentation for Z
     test: add tests for feature X
     ```
   - Keep commits focused and atomic.

3. **Stay Up-to-Date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Pull Request** from your feature branch to the main Intric repository.

2. **Pull Request Title and Description**:

   - Use a clear, descriptive title.
   - Include a detailed description explaining the changes and their purpose.
   - Reference any related issues using GitHub keywords: "Fixes #123" or "Resolves #456".

3. **Code Review**:

   - All PRs require at least one review from a maintainer.
   - Address all feedback from reviewers.
   - Make requested changes in new commits, then squash them before merging.

4. **CI Checks**:

   - All tests must pass before merging.
   - Code must meet linting standards.
   - Documentation must be updated if applicable.

5. **Merging**:
   - PRs will be merged by a maintainer after approval.
   - We typically use squash merging to keep the history clean.

## Coding Standards

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guide.
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values.
- Write docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules.
- Use Poetry for dependency management.
- Maintain at least 80% test coverage for new code.

### Frontend Code

- Follow the project's ESLint configuration.
- Use SvelteKit conventions for components and routing.
- Use pnpm for package management.
- Maintain responsive and accessible design principles.
- Document component props and events.

### Domain-Driven Design

- Follow the DDD principles outlined in [Domain Driven Design](domain-driven-design.md).
- Ensure new features align with the existing architecture.
- Organize code by business domain, not technical function.
- Use repositories for data access, services for business logic.

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality.
- Run existing tests before submitting a PR: `poetry run pytest` for backend, `pnpm run test` for frontend.
- Include both unit and integration tests when appropriate.
- Follow test naming conventions and organize tests by domain.
- Backend tests are located in `tests/` directory, following the domain structure.

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any feature, API, or behavior changes.
- Document all public APIs using appropriate docstrings.
- Follow the existing documentation style.
- Ensure README and relevant guides are updated if applicable.
- Use clear, concise language and include examples where helpful.
