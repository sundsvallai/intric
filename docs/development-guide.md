## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Poetry (Python dependency management)
- pnpm 9.12.3 (Node.js package manager)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- libmagic and ffmpeg

### Additional system requirements

To be able to use the platform to the fullest, install `libmagic` and `ffmpeg`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmagic1
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/intric-ai/intric-community.git
   cd intric-community
   ```

2. **Set up environment files**:

   ```bash
   # For backend development
   cp backend/.env.template backend/.env

   # For frontend development
   cp frontend/apps/web/.env.example frontend/apps/web/.env
   ```

3. **Start infrastructure services**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Set up backend**:

   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the backend directory
   cd backend

   # Install dependencies using Poetry
   poetry install

   # Initialize database (first time only)
   poetry run python init_db.py

   # Start the backend service
   poetry run start
   ```

5. **Set up frontend**:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend directory
   cd frontend

   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install

   # Set up packages
   pnpm run setup

   # Start the frontend development server (from frontend root)
   pnpm -w run dev
   ```

6. **Start the worker** (optional but recommended, in a third terminal):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry run arq src.intric.worker.arq.WorkerSettings
   ```

### Accessing the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Default login credentials**:
  - Email: `user@example.com`
  - Password: `Password1!`

> **Note**: These login credentials are automatically created when you run the database initialization step.

### Environment Files

Intric uses different environment files for different components:

1. **Backend Development**:

   - File: `backend/.env`
   - Template: `backend/.env.template`
   - Key settings:
     ```
     POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
     POSTGRES_PORT=5432
     REDIS_HOST=localhost
     REDIS_PORT=6379
     JWT_SECRET=your_development_secret_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key  # If using OpenAI
     ```

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - File: `frontend/apps/web/.env`
   - Template: `frontend/apps/web/.env.example`
   - Key settings:
     ```
     INTRIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
     JWT_SECRET=your_development_secret_key
     ```

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify your backend `.env` file has the correct connection details for PostgreSQL and Redis, pointing to `localhost` with the correct ports.

- **Frontend Not Connecting to Backend**: Ensure your frontend environment file has `INTRIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000`.

### Using Devcontainer for Development

The project is configured to use a devcontainer, which allows you to develop in a consistent environment using Visual Studio Code and Docker. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:

   - Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.
   - Install Visual Studio Code and the Remote - Containers extension.

2. **Copy Environment Files**:

   - Before starting development, you need to set up your environment files:

     ```bash
     # In the backend directory
     cp .env.template .env

     # In the frontend/apps/web directory
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Remember to update these .env files with appropriate values.

3. **Open the Project in a Devcontainer**:

   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
   - When prompted, or by clicking on the green icon in the bottom-left corner, select "Reopen in Container".
   - This will build the devcontainer as defined in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

4. **Accessing Services**:

   - The devcontainer setup will automatically forward ports 3000 and 8000, allowing you to access the frontend and backend services running on these ports.

5. **Post-Create Commands**:

   - After the container is created, the `postCreateCommand` specified in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` will run, setting up the environment.

6. **Developing**:

   - You can now develop as usual within the container. The environment will have all necessary dependencies installed and configured.

   **Important Notes**:

   - Database migrations are not run automatically. After the container is created, you'll need to run:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     poetry run python init_db.py
     ```
   - You'll need to manually start both the backend and frontend services in separate terminal windows:

     For the backend:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     poetry run start
     ```

     For the frontend:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     pnpm run setup
     pnpm -w run dev
     ```

     Running the frontend and backend in separate terminal windows gives you better control over each service's lifecycle. This makes it easier to restart individual services when needed, such as after installing new dependencies or when troubleshooting issues.

7. **Stopping the Devcontainer**:
   - To stop the devcontainer, simply close Visual Studio Code or use the "Remote - Containers: Reopen Folder Locally" command.

This setup ensures that all developers work in the same environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.

## Backend Development

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Task Queue**: ARQ (Redis-based)
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Testing**: pytest

### Key Components

#### Domain-Driven Structure

The backend follows domain-driven design principles with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Domain Entities** (`src/intric/domain_name/domain_name.py`) - Core business models
2. **Repositories** (`src/intric/domain_name/domain_name_repo.py`) - Data access layer
3. **Services** (`src/intric/domain_name/domain_name_service.py`) - Business logic
4. **API Routes** (`src/intric/domain_name/api/domain_name_router.py`) - HTTP endpoints

#### API Structure

The API layer is organized by domain:

1. **API Models** (`src/intric/domain_name/api/domain_name_models.py`) - Request/response schemas
2. **API Routes** (`src/intric/domain_name/api/domain_name_router.py`) - API endpoints
3. **Assemblers** (`src/intric/domain_name/api/domain_name_assembler.py`) - Transform between domain and API models

#### Background Processing

Long-running tasks are handled by a worker service using ARQ:

1. Tasks are defined in each domain's corresponding worker module
2. The worker process is run separately in production
3. Task statuses are tracked in Redis

#### Database

The database schema is managed with SQLAlchemy and Alembic:

1. Models are defined in each domain's models module
2. Migrations are stored in the `alembic/versions/` directory
3. For vector embeddings, the pgvector extension is used

### Running Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest
```

### Database Migrations

We use [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for our database migrations. When you make changes to the database models, you'll need to generate and apply migrations:

```bash
# Generate a new migration
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Apply migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

## Frontend Development

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **UI Components**: Custom component library
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API with custom wrapper
- **State Management**: Svelte stores
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS

### Key Components

#### UI Components

The frontend uses a component-based architecture:

- **Layout Components** - Page layout and structure
- **Feature Components** - Domain-specific UI components
- **Common UI Components** - Reusable UI elements
- **Form Components** - Form inputs and validation

#### State Management

Svelte stores are used for state management:

- **Authentication** - User authentication state
- **Settings** - User preferences
- **Assistants** - Assistant configurations
- **Session** - Current chat session

#### API Integration

API requests are handled through service modules:

- **API Service** - Base API request handling
- **Auth Service** - Authentication operations
- **Assistant Service** - Assistant management
- **Session Service** - Chat session operations

### Running Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test
```

## Architectural Patterns

### Domain-Driven Design

Intric follows domain-driven design principles:

1. **Ubiquitous Language** - Consistent terminology across code and documentation
2. **Bounded Contexts** - Clear domain boundaries
3. **Entities and Value Objects** - Domain models with identity or value semantics
4. **Repositories** - Data access abstraction
5. **Domain Services** - Business logic operations

For more details on the domain-driven design approach, see the [Domain-Driven Design document](./domain-driven-design.md).

### Feature Architecture

The architecture for each feature strives to look like this:

```
feature_x/
├── api/
│   ├── feature_x_models.py
│   ├── feature_x_assembler.py
│   └── feature_x_router.py
├── feature_x.py
├── feature_x_repo.py
├── feature_x_service.py
└── feature_x_factory.py
```

An example of this can be seen in the `Spaces` feature.

#### Function of each module

- **feature_x.py** - The main class, the main domain object. Domain logic pertaining to how the feature works should live here.
- **feature_x_repo.py** - Dependency inversion of database dependency. Should input a `Feature_x` class (or an `id`) and return that same class.
- **feature_x_service.py** - Responsible for connecting this domain object with other related ones.
- **feature_x_factory.py** - Factory class. Creates the domain object.
- **feature_x_router.py** - Specifies the endpoints.
- **feature_x_models.py** - Definition of the API schema.
- **feature_x_assembler.py** - Translates domain objects to the API schema, allowing for the schema to change without affecting the shape of the domain object.

### Dependency Injection

We use a [dependency injection framework](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/index.html) to handle dependency injection for us. This framework creates all the necessary classes and handles their inter-dependency. This is typically done in the router.

### Connecting Features

Add the router in the main router (located at `src/intric/server/routers.py`) to connect the endpoints to the application.

### Microservices

The application is structured as a set of loosely coupled services:

1. **Frontend Service** - SvelteKit Node.js server serving the application directly
2. **Backend API** - FastAPI application handling business logic
3. **Worker Service** - Background task processor
4. **Database** - PostgreSQL with pgvector
5. **Cache** - Redis for task queue and caching

For the complete architectural overview, refer to the [Architecture document](./architecture.md).

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

Intric uses a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **API Tests** - Test API endpoints
4. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user flows

### Test Organization

Tests are organized following the domain structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/                     # Unit tests
│   └── domain_name/          # Tests for specific domain
├── integration/              # Integration tests
│   └── domain_name/          # Tests for specific domain
└── api/                      # API tests
    └── domain_name/          # Tests for domain API
```

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths:

1. **Backend** - Minimum 80% code coverage
2. **Frontend** - Test all critical user flows
3. **Automated Testing** - CI pipeline runs tests on each commit

## Documentation

### API Documentation

The API is documented using OpenAPI/Swagger:

- Access at `http://localhost:8000/docs` during development
